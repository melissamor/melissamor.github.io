## Who am I?
I am a queer astronomy PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison working with Eric Wilcots. I am interested in learning about how galaxies evolve in groups, where they are surrounded by tens of neighbors and embedded in a dense gaseous medium. My thesis work aims to answer these questions using radio galaxies with bent jets as probes of the intragroup medium.

I'm also very passionate about education and mentoring, having mentored four undergrads and taught an introductory astronomy course in grad school.

I also really really love my dog.
