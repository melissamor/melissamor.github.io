### Looking around bent AGN
You should check out my most recent paper! I'll find a way to link it here!

### How much gas is in the intragroup medium, anyways?
Keep an eye out for my next paper! It'll be real great!

Getting help from three fantastic undergrads to do this! I'm going to talk more about it eventually!
